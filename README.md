# Flutter Developer Test
Objective:
The goal of this test is to assess your skills in working with Flutter, API integration, UI design, and state management. You will create a simple Flutter application that fetches data from an API, displays it in a list, and includes a custom UI component.

Requirements:

API Integration:

Connect the application to a public API (such as JSONPlaceholder: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).
Fetch data (a list of items) from the API and display it in the UI.
Custom UI Component:

Create a custom text input field that simulates a 4-digit code input.
The input should be split into four separate text fields, each accepting only one digit.
As the user types in one field, the focus should automatically move to the next field. If the user deletes a digit, the focus should move back to the previous field.
State Management:

Use a state management solution like BLoC to manage the application's state.
Handle the loading, success, and error states when fetching data from the API.
Project Structure:

Organize your code following best practices for project structure.
Include models, repositories, BLoC (or another state management), and UI components in separate files.
Deliverables:

A Flutter project that meets the requirements outlined above.
The project should be well-structured and easy to understand.
Include any necessary instructions to run the project, including how to install dependencies and run the application.
Submission:

Upload your project to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and provide the link.
Ensure your project is runnable without any issues.
Evaluation Criteria:

Code quality and organization
Proper use of Flutter widgets and state management
UI/UX implementation
API integration and error handling
